Feature: Mixed LDAP and Local authentication
  User with "LDAP auth only" should be able to login with LDAP, but not with Local credentials.
  User without "LDAP auth only" should be able to login both with LDAP and Local credentials.

  Scenario: Existing LDAP user tries to login using local auth, but is configured with "LDAP Authentication Only"
    Given As "sugarAdmin" filling in the following LDAP settings:
      | field | type | value |
      | ldap_hostname | text | ldap |
      | ldap_port | text | 389 |
      | ldap_base_dn | text |  dc=openldap,dc=com |
      | ldap_login_filter | text | |
      | ldap_bind_attr    | text | dn |
      | ldap_login_attr    | text | uid |
      | ldap_group_checkbox    | checkbox | |
      | ldap_authentication_checkbox    | checkbox | checked |
      | ldap_admin_user    | text | cn=admin,ou=admins,dc=openldap,dc=com |
      | ldap_admin_password    | text | admin&password |
      | ldap_auto_create_users | checkbox | |
    And I wait for element "input[name=username]"
    Then As "sugarAdmin" I create Sugar user with the following properties:
      | field  | value |
      | user_name | user1 |
      | user_hash | user1Local |
      | email1    | user1@test.com |
      | status    | Active |
      | external_auth_only | 1 |
    And I wait for element "input[name=username]"
    Then I login as "user1" with password "user1"
    And I wait for element "input[name=first_name]"
    And I should see "Setup your user information"
    Then I skip login wizard
    And I wait until the loading is completed
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    And I should see "Accounts"
    And I wait until the loading is completed
    Then I logout
    And I wait for element "input[name=username]"
    Then I login as "user1" with password "user1Local"
    And I should see "Invalid Credentials"
    And I should not see "Accounts"
