  @br-5763 @regression @extended
  Scenario: Login user with custom datetime preference
    Given I am on "/"
    When As "sugarAdmin" I create Sugar user with the following properties:
      | field  | value |
      | user_name | userDateTime |
      | user_hash | userDateTime |
      | email1    | userDateTime@test.com |
      | status    | Active |
    Then I wait for the page to be loaded
    Given I login as "userDateTime" with password "userDateTime"
    Then I skip login wizard
    And I update user preferences with this data:
      | field | value |
      | datef | m.d.Y |
      | timef | h:i A |
    And I logout
    Then I wait until the loading is completed
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    Given I login as "userDateTime" with password "userDateTime"
    Then I wait for the element ".headerpane"
    And I should see "Home Dashboard"
    And I logout
    And I wait until the loading is completed
    And I wait for the page to be loaded
    # now the second time to check the bug
    Given I login as "userDateTime" with password "userDateTime"
    Then I wait for the element ".headerpane"
    And I should see "Home Dashboard"
    And I logout
